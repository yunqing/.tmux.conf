# Development Environment One-Click Setup
Including shell(`zsh` with `prezto`), git, vim, tmux, pyenv.

## tmux
[tmux-plugins/tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) do not work well with tmux whose version is lower than 2.0.
I use tpm, so `.tmux.conf` is only compatible with tmux 2.0+.
Place `.tmux.conf` into `~`

## vim
I use [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) to manage vim plugins.

File `my_configs.vim` should be placed as `~/.vim_runtime/my_configs.vim`
